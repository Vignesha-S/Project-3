# K-Means Clustering - Mall Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**. The goal is to group customers into clusters that exhibit similar characteristics for targeted marketing or customer segmentation strategies.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository. It contains customer data with the following columns:

- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: The gender of the customer.
- `Age`: The age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned to customers based on their spending behavior.
- You can directly use this dataset to replicate the customer segmentation process.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vignesha-S/Project-3.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, manually install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vignesha-S/Project-3.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`k_means_clustering.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook k_means_clustering.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure
- `k_means_clustering.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook file that contains all steps, including data loading, exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`).
- `requirements.txt`: A file containing the list of dependencies for the project.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded and inspected for its structure.
   - Features such as **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** are selected for clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Histograms and KDE plots are used to understand the distribution of features (Age and Spending Score).
   - A correlation heatmap is generated to check the relationships between the features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data is scaled using `StandardScaler` to normalize the features and prepare them for clustering.

4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - The Elbow Method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is found to be **4**.
   - The K-Means model is trained on the scaled data to segment the customers into 4 clusters.

5. **Centroids Visualization**:
   - After clustering, the centroids of the clusters are visualized in a 3D plot along with the customer data points.

6. **Cluster Summary and Interpretation**:
   - A summary of each cluster is generated by calculating the mean values of **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** within each cluster.
   - Insights such as high-income vs. low-income groups, and high-spending vs. low-spending groups are provided.

7. **Final Visualization**:
   - A final 2D plot is generated to visualize the clusters and their centroids, helping to understand the customer segments in the feature space.

## Results
- The K-Means algorithm successfully segmented the customers into 4 clusters based on their **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**.
- The clusters represent different customer segments that can be targeted for marketing strategies, such as:
  - Cluster 0: High-income and low-spending group.
  - Cluster 1: High-income and high-spending group.
  - Cluster 2: Low-income and medium-spending group.
  - Cluster 3: Medium-income and low-spending group.
